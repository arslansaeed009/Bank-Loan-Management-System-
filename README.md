# Bank-Loan-Management-System
A console-based Bank Loan Management System developed in C++. This system allows users to manage loan applications, calculate interest, and handle repayments.
## Features
- **Add Loans:** Add new loan entries with details such as amount, interest rate, and term.
- **Make Payments:** Make payments towards existing loans and update the remaining balance.
- **Display Loans:** View details of all loans including remaining balance.
- **Calculate Payments:** Calculate and display the monthly payment amount for each loan.
## Technologies Used
- **C++: The programming language used for development.**
## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- **A C++ compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC).**
- **A development environment (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any IDE of your choice).**
  ## Installation
  1. Clone the Repository:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-loan-management-system.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
    ```sh
    cd bank-loan-management-system
3. Compile the Source Code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o loan_management_system loan_management_system.cpp
4. Run the Executable:
    ```sh
    ./loan_management_system
    ```
    ## Usage
- **Use the menu to display all loans, make payments, and calculate monthly payments.**
- **Follow the prompts to input loan IDs, payment amounts, and other details.**
## How It Works
- **Loan Management:** Handles loan details, interest calculations, and payments.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a console-based interface for managing loans.
## Limitations
- **Basic functionality for demonstration purposes.**
- **No data persistence (all data is lost when the program exits).**
## Future Enhancements
-**Implement data persistence using file handling to save and load loan information.**
- **Add advanced features such as loan approval workflows and detailed reports.**
- **Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.**
